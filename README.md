## 👋 About Me  

I’m a **Cybersecurity Analyst** passionate about **protecting systems, investigating threats, and responding to incidents** in real and simulated environments.  

With hands-on experience in **SIEM monitoring, intrusion detection, and vulnerability assessment**, I specialize in analyzing log data, correlating alerts, and identifying suspicious activities across hybrid infrastructures.  

I enjoy turning raw data into actionable security insights and continuously learning new tools, frameworks, and methodologies to stay ahead of modern cyber threats.  

My goal is to **strengthen organizational resilience** through proactive monitoring, automation, and a well-documented incident response process.
